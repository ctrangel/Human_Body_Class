      <h2>Introduction to Hearing</h2>
      <img src="/media/hearing1.jpg" alt="Hearing Image 1">
      <p>Hearing is one of the most important senses that we possess. It allows us to communicate, enjoy music and other
        sounds, and be aware of our surroundings. Our ears are complex organs that enable us to detect, process and
        interpret sounds, and send signals to our brains for further processing.<br>

        The ear is divided into three parts: the outer ear, the middle ear, and the inner ear. The outer ear consists of
        the visible part of the ear and the ear canal. It collects sound waves and directs them to the middle ear. The
        middle ear contains the eardrum and three tiny bones, which amplify and transmit the sound vibrations to the
        inner ear. The inner ear contains the cochlea, a fluid-filled structure lined with tiny hair cells that convert
        the sound vibrations into electrical signals that are sent to the brain through the auditory nerve.<br>

        Sound waves are a type of mechanical energy that travels through the air. When they reach the ear, they cause
        the eardrum to vibrate, which in turn causes the tiny bones in the middle ear to vibrate. The vibrations are
        then transmitted to the fluid in the inner ear, where they stimulate the hair cells. The hair cells convert the
        mechanical energy of the sound waves into electrical signals that are sent to the brain for further
        processing.<br>

        Hearing is a complex process that involves many different parts of the ear and the brain. It plays a crucial
        role in our daily lives, allowing us to communicate, learn, and enjoy the world around us. Understanding the
        basics of hearing is important for maintaining good hearing health and for treating hearing loss when it occurs.
