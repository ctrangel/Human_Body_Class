        <p>Why want it? Why do you want to hear things? Why is it important ?</p> <br>
        <p>
          Hearing is undoubtedly one of the most important senses that we possess. From an evolutionary standpoint, it
          allows us to be better aware of our surroundings, such as recognizing and reacting to sounds of threats or
          warnings. Such as something like a snake’s rattle or a predator trying to sneak up on you. Today, this would
          be
          better exemplified by a siren, horn, or emergency alert. The ability to use our sense of hearing in
          combination
          with our brain’s ability to process and comprehend different sounds as languages also play a major role in our
          survival and overall quality of life. Although ‘language’ is a vastly complex concept that humans and animals
          can both utilize effectively without the use of hearing, It would be counterproductive not to recognize the
          role
          that hearing plays in our way of communication. This communication then enables us to learn, instruct, and
          engage in meaningful discussions. This is important, considering that we are a very social species. Being able
          to effectively communicate and socialize again greatly improves our mental health and overall quality of life.
          This is why it’s very important to provide ways to allow people who have difficulty hearing or are deaf to be
          able to access other ways of effective communication, such as sign language or subtitles.<a

      <p>Fundamentally, like most other major senses, hearing involves having outside environmental stimuli converted by
        our sensory organs (in this case, the ears) into electrical signals that are interpreted by a certain part of
        the brain. Hearing starts with sound waves. I will get into more detail soon. These soundwaves are first
        funneled into the outer ear. The outer ear consists of the ear itself and the ear canal. The sound waves make
        their way to the middle ear. The middle ear has three small bones. As you probably already know are some of the
        smallest bones in the Human body. They include the hammer, anvil, and stirrup. The middle ear also includes the
        ear drum. When sound waves hit the ear drum, it causes the ear drum to vibrate, and the waves are then
        transmitted through the three little bones to the inner ear. The inner ear is where the sound waves are
        processed and converted to signals for the brain to interpret. The cochlea is a snail-shaped structure or one of
        those shells from the beach, that is filled with fluid and hair cells. The fluid moves the fluid, which moves
        the hairs that have a lot of nerve endings attached to them. Those nerve endings then send the signals. Of
        course, it’s the brain’s job to then interpret those signals, and not everyone will interpret a certain sound or
        frequency the same. Different music tastes, perhaps.<a href="#what-sound-waves">Sound Waves!</a> </p>
    </div>

    <div id="what-sound-waves" class="section">
      <h2>What are sound waves? What makes sound? What is that noise? What is that melody?? </h2>
      <img id="sound-wave-img" src="/media/hearing3.jpg" alt="Hearing Image 3">
      <p>Sound is produced when an object vibrates. This creates a ‘pressure wave’. A wave is essentially just energy
        flowing through a medium. In this case, the medium would be the air hence why you wouldn’t be able to hear in
        space. However, sound can travel through any medium, like water. Just not as easily. In a lot of ways, sound
        waves are like light waves. They both originate from a definite source and can be refracted and dampened in a
        number of ways. </p>
      <p>There are also 4 basic elements of a sound wave.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          • Frequency (pitch)
          <small>
            o Think of Higher or lower sounds
          </small>
        </li>
        <li>
          • Amplitude (dynamics)
          <small>
            o Think , loudness. How loud or quiet is it.
          </small>
        <li>
          • Timbre (Tone Color)
          <small>
            o Think of different types of instruments. The tone is different on the piano than on the lute.
          </small>
        </li>
        <li>
          • Duration (tempo)
          <small>
            o Think , how long does this note last or is sustained?
          </small>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p> The science of waves themselves is a very interesting and complex topic, but we’re going to talk a little
        about
        what kind of sound waves our ears are able to pick up. <a href="#what-do-we-hear">What Can We Hear!</a></p>

    </div>

    <div id="what-do-we-hear" class="section">
      <h2>What are we hearing right now?</h2>
      <img src="/media/hearing4.jpg" alt="Hearing Image 4">
      <p>The frequency of a sound wave is measured in Hz. The Human ear can pick up frequencies from about 20 Hz to
        about 20 kHz, or 20,000 Hz. Interestingly, most people become less sensitive to high frequencies over time, so
        the average limit for adults is more so 15 kHz to 17 kHz. The sounds that we cannot hear have names for those
        sound waves. Anything below 20 Hz is considered an infrasonic wave. Anything above 20 kHz is considered an
        Ultrasonic wave. So even though we can’t actually hear these frequencies, they are still very useful to us.
        Geologists often use infrasonic waves to detect earthquakes, and of course, in medicine, the Ultrasound uses
        Ultrasonic waves. <a href="#which-one">Soothing frequencies</a> </p>
    </div>

    <div id="which-one" class="section">
      <h2>What frequencies do we find most pleasant? White, pink, or brown noise?</h2>
      <img src="/media/hearing5.jpg" alt="Hearing Image 5">
      <p>White noise is technically a noise that contains all frequencies across the entire sound spectrum that we can
        observe. It kind of sounds more like the ocean, wind, or tv static. I found that the difference between the
        three sounds mostly had to do with the amplitude of different ends of the spectrum. For example, pink noise has
        louder low-end frequencies and softer hi-end. Brown is pretty much just an exaggerated pink with an even lower
        low-end that sounds more like a rumble. Kind of like the sound you hear when you’re in an airplane. People often
        use fans and other things similar to that to produce sustained white noise.

        Research has shown that exposure to this sustained mashup of frequencies can be beneficial to our well-being in
        a few different ways, like improving sleep, reducing crying babies, and improving focus.<a

      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>Hearing plays a big role in survival and quality of life<br>
        Soundwaves are funneled into the ear canal and are processed and transmitted to the brain.<br>
        Sound waves are created from vibrations; they’re what make noise.<br>
        The Human ear can pick up frequencies from about 20 Hz to about 20 kHz, or 20,000 Hz.<br>
        I like pink noise the best. Although there is a ton of different ways you can use different frequencies to
        benefit your physical and mental health.
